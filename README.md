# Transcript Advisor

## <ins>DESCRIPTION</ins>
This is a system that helps a student to determine his or her progress toward meeting graduation requirements.  The system is similar to the “Advising Transcript” that is available to DePauw students through e-Services. However, this electronic advising transcript will be a bit more flexible in that it will allow students to select exactly what types of information they want to display.
